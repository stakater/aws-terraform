If you use Vagrant, instead of install tools on your host machine, there is Vagranetfile for a Ubuntu box with all the necessary tools installed.

# Install Vagrant


#### Windows

1. Confirm the `hardware virtualization` is enabled in BIOS; as otherwise virtual machine won't boot

# 

```
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd aws-terraform
```
